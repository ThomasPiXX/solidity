//quesiton to myself , variable state are changed while function are called therefore
/* it is only while function are executed and write to external which mean write to state(write to storage)
that it will cost gas fee otherwise function can run inside a contract without cost 
so its the action fo writing to storage that cost something */

/*
public - any contract or EOA can call into this function
external - only other contracts (external to the current contract) and EOAs can call, no internal calling
internal - only this contract along with its inheritance chain can call
private - only this contract can call
ðŸš¨ State variables work off the same exact criteria for visibility. State variables can be declared as public, private, or internal but not external.
